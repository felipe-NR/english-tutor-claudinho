# ADR-0001: The tutor lives in the portable core, and hooks only trigger it

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-09-13
- Decider: Felipe Neves Ricardo
- Full analysis: [implementation plan, section 3](../implementation-plan.md) (pt-BR)
- Diagram: [architecture and data flow](../implementation-plan.md#4-arquitetura-proposta) (pt-BR) shows this two-layer split, the capture paths and where corrections are stored.

## Context

The reference design ([Luna, 2026-02-04](https://blog.stackademic.com/turning-my-coding-tool-into-an-english-tutor-with-claude-code-hooks-de3384f09b7f)) corrects English through Claude Code hooks. `UserPromptSubmit` injects a correction instruction on every message, and `SessionStart` injects the whole practice log.

This project must follow [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) and install with each client's native plugin command. The spec standardizes two component types, Agent Skills and MCP servers. Its Design Decisions keep commands, hooks, agents, rules and LSP servers out of v1 because they "remain too client-specific for a stable portable contract". Client-specific manifest data goes under `extensions`, and client-specific files go in a top-level directory named for the client's reverse-domain namespace (§8).

The tutor needs five capabilities: a trigger on every user message, pedagogical content, deterministic recording of mistakes, retrieval (session briefing, reports, review) and native installation. Lifecycle hooks are the only mechanism that fires deterministically on every message, and hooks are the component type the spec leaves out.

Client support observed on 2026-09-13:

| Client | Loads Agent Plugins 1.0 | Per-message context injection |
|-|-|-|
| Claude Code 2.1.270 | no | yes, `UserPromptSubmit` |
| Codex CLI 0.153.4 and 0.154.0 | yes | yes with the legacy package's `UserPromptSubmit`; plugin hooks need a trust review |
| GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.78 | yes | no, output of file-based `userPromptSubmitted` hooks is dropped |
| Antigravity CLI 1.1.27 | partially | yes, `PreInvocation` |

## Decision

Split the tutor into two layers.

1. **Portable core** in the Agent Plugins package `plugin/`: the `english-tutor` skill, the `english-tutor` MCP server and the bundled `tutor` CLI that the server runs. The correction protocol, the pt-BR profile, storage, briefing, reports and review live here.
2. **Trigger adapters**, one per client. Each one is declared in distribution metadata outside the package (the Claude Code marketplace entry) or in a generated compatibility package outside `plugin/` (`adapters/codex/` for Codex, see the update below). An adapter calls `tutor hook <client> <event>` and only translates that client's input and output formats.

Clients without per-message injection run in Standard mode: the user turns tutor mode on for the session, and the model records mistakes through an MCP tool. Skills-only clients run in Minimal mode, with on-demand corrections and no history.

`plugin/` stays fully conformant to the spec, and `npm run validate:plugin` enforces the layout.

## Consequences

- Clients that load the required portable components and MCP transport load the core without client-specific code.
- Supporting a new client takes one adapter and one spike, with no change to the core.
- Claude Code, the main client, depends on a marketplace entry with `strict: false` until it implements Agent Plugins.
- Codex depends on the generated legacy package until it loads hooks from Agent Plugins packages.
- Hook contracts change between client versions, so each adapter needs contract tests with recorded payloads.
- Per-message reinforcement exists only in clients that offer it.

## Update 2026-09-13: Codex hooks

The Phase 1 spikes ([docs/compatibility.md](../compatibility.md)) showed that Codex 0.153.4 never loads hooks from a package with a root `plugin.json`, whatever `extensions.com.openai.hooks` declares. The 0.154.0 recheck repeated the result for canonical, legacy and mixed packages. The Codex loader returns no hook sources for the Agent Plugins manifest format, although the OpenAI documentation describes that field. Codex does load hooks from legacy `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` packages.

Decision D12: the build generates `adapters/codex/`, a legacy Codex package with the same skills, bundle and metadata as `plugin/` plus `hooks/hooks.json`, and the Codex marketplace points to it. `plugin/` stays fully conformant. The adapter goes away when Codex loads hooks from Agent Plugins packages.

## Revisit when

- Agent Plugins publishes a release after 1.0.0, especially one that adds hooks.
- Claude Code implements Agent Plugins.
- A Codex release loads hooks from Agent Plugins packages.
